# New Beginnings

I'm so drawn to fresh starts. I'm reminded of Lamentations 3:23: 
> 
> Great is his faithfulness;his mercies begin afresh each morning.

I don't believe that God's mercies are new only in the morning. I believe that they can be new each minute. If I take a moment to really focus on Him, take a deep breath, and allow Him (again) to have control in my life, it all starts over from there. There is always hope.
