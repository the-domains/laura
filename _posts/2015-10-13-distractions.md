# Distractions
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/79095b6c-93c4-405a-8f0e-3428f263c728.jpg)

With so much going on in my life, I have no business picking up new hobbies.  I guess I'm just somewhat of a rebel. So much of a rebel that I've picked up knitting this week.  Bad-ass, I know. Will I drop it in a week like a bad habit?  It's definitely a possibility, especially once it dawns on me that I have currently much more important things to do that are time-sensitive.  I do believe in self-care and I find knitting to be pretty relaxing so far.  Watching Fed Up or Grey's Anatomy while crafting something by hand in bed is pretty awesome.

And let's be honest here... life is full of heavy stuff. Sometimes we need to quiet our minds and doing something with my hands somehow helps me to do that.  So often these days we see blogs and Facebook posts ranting about how distracted the world is now, but distractions can also be positive.  One definition of distractions reads, "a thing that prevents someone from giving full attention to something else."  Maybe, just for a moment, we need to stop giving our full attention the weight on our shoulders.  Maybe we need to take our eyes off of our problems and quiet our minds.

_Is there something that you love indulging in or a hobby that you have thought about picking up?_
